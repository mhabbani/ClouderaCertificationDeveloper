Using sqoop, import products_replica table from MYSQL into hdfs such that fields are separated by a ‘|’ and lines are separated by ‘\n’. Null values are represented as -1 for numbers and “NOT-AVAILABLE” for strings. Only records with product id greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 1000 should be imported and use 3 mappers for importing. The destination file should be stored as a text file to directory  /user/`whoami`/problem5/products-text.


sqoop import --connect jdbc:mysql://localhost/retail_db --username root --password cloudera --table products_replica --target-dir /user/cloudera/problem5/products-text --fields-terminated-by '|' --input-null-string "NOT-AVAILABLE"  --input-null-non-string -1 --where "product_id >= 1 and product_id <= 1000" -m 3



Using sqoop, import products_replica table from MYSQL into hdfs such that fields are separated by a ‘*’ and lines are separated by ‘\n’. Null values are represented as -1000 for numbers and “NA” for strings. Only records with product id less than or equal to 1111 should be imported and use 2 mappers for importing. The destination file should be stored as a text file to directory  /user/`whoami`/problem5/products-text-part1.

Using sqoop, import products_replica table from MYSQL into hdfs such that fields are separated by a ‘*’ and lines are separated by ‘\n’. Null values are represented as -1000 for numbers and “NA” for strings. Only records with product id greater than 1111 should be imported and use 5 mappers for importing.

create a sqoop job Import Products_replica table as text file to directory /user/`whoami`/problem5/products-incremental. Import all the records.
insert three more records to Products_replica from mysql
run the sqoop job again so that only newly added records can be pulled from mysql
insert 2 more records to Products_replica from mysql
run the sqoop job again so that only newly added records can be pulled from mysql
Validate to make sure the records have not be duplicated in HDFS
